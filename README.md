# TestNG-Annotations-Demo
This repository demonstrates the usage of TestNG annotations in Java with clear examples of @BeforeSuite, @AfterSuite, @BeforeTest, @AfterTest, @BeforeClass, @AfterClass, @BeforeMethod, and @AfterMethod. It includes two test classes, multiple test cases, and a testng.xml file to showcase execution order and lifecycle methods.
